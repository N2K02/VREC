     * begins "if (mIsClosed) return", and mIsClosed is exactly what the
     * connection thread sets when adbd's CLSE arrives - so for any stream the
     * remote closed first, which is every one-shot command, close() returns
     * early and the reciprocal CLSE is never sent. adbd is left holding
     * half-open sockets, and refuses new ones once it has collected enough.
     * Measured: commands 1-8 fine, 9 onwards "Stream closed." for good.
     * Retrying cannot help, because nothing about it is transient.
     *
     * WHY exec: AND NOT shell:
     *
     * A persistent shell needs clean I/O, and `shell:` with no command makes
     * adbd allocate a PTY. A PTY echoes back everything written to it and
     * prints a prompt, so output arrives as "HNBKQ:/ $ id" interleaved with
     * real results, and the sentinel line never matches because it turns up
     * wearing a prompt. Turning that off from inside with `stty -echo` only
     * desynchronised things further. The `exec:` service never allocates a PTY,
     * which makes `exec:sh` a persistent shell with clean pipes.
     *
     * A persistent shell never signals end-of-output, so a sentinel marks it:
     * write the command, then echo a marker, and read until the marker comes
     * back. It is random per session so no command's own output can collide.
